# pixelConnect
PixelConnect is a windows form's application I have made which plays a game of connect 4. This was a college project which I have somewhat completed on my own.

It has all the basic things that a connect-four styled game would have, including two different players/counters, circlular slots for the counters, reset button to reset the game, and some basic algorithms to recognise if there has been four in a row.

I would like to mention that I got the original code from:
https://github.com/tylersriver/Connect-4/tree/master

I have used this as a template as to what I wanted for my own connect-four styled game to learn how it works and study it, finding ways to improve it and give it my own twist. I have enhanced, improved, or added the following things to this project:
- I have implimented anti aliasing on the rendered board graphics so that it's smoother rather than pixelated like it was.
- I have added a couner that follows the mouse on the x axis hovering above the board so that it gives an additional indication as to who's turn it is and just as a visulisation thing. Originally this was lagging and wasn't smooth but I added some double buffering to this which solved the issue.
- I have changed all the colours. I was originally aiming for pac-man styled colours but this entire interface doens't remind me of pac-man whatsoever.
- I have created a simple and quick icon which represets the game and application.
